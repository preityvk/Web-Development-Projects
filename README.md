1. **Weather Application**: This Weather App lets users check real-time weather conditions for any city. It displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons, using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for a city, and the app dynamically updates or shows an error for invalid cities.
2. **To-Do List Application**: The code creates a To-Do List web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, check, and remove tasks, which are stored in `localStorage` for persistence. The app features a clean design with rounded elements, hover effects, and visual indicators for completed tasks.
